ScalaLogging
============

Scala logging library wrapping <a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">SLF4J</a> and <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/">Log4j 2</a> in a convenient and performant fashion.

In principle the call of log messages should be avoided if the given log level is not enabled. Hence we should write the following code to log at the `debug` level:

    if (logger.isDebugEnabled) logger.debug(s"Some ${expensiveExpression} message!")

This is even true in the presence of parameterized log methods like available for <a href="http://logback.qos.ch">Logback</a>, at least if readability matters:

    if (logger.isDebugEnabled) logger.debug("Some {} message!", expensiveExpression)

Yet this idiom is too heavyweight, so that many of us just omit the `isEnabled`-check. Fortunately <a href="http://scalamacros.org/">Scala macros</a> can be used to make our lives easier: ScalaLogging offers the class `Logger` with lightweight logging methods that will be expanded to the above idiom. So all we have to write is:

    logger.debug(s"Some ${expensiveExpression} message!")

After the macro has been applied, the code will have been transformed into the above described idiom.

In addition ScalaLogging offers the trait `Logging` which conveniently provides a `Logger` instance initialized with the name of the class mixed into:

    class MyClass extends Logging {
      logger.debug("This is very convenient ;-)")
    }

Prerequisites
-------------

* Scala 2.10.1
* SLF4J 1.7.5 or Log4j 2.0-beta4

Using ScalaLogging
------------------

ScalaLogging is published to the Sonatype OSS snapshot and release repositories. As the Sonatype OSS release repository is mirrored to Maven Central (with a certain delay), you can use releases without adding custom resolvers to your sbt build definition or custom repositories to your Maven POM. The group id (organization) is `com.typesafe` and the artifact ids (names) are `scalalogging-slf4j` and `scalalogging-log4j`.

The following example shows how to add a dependency to the latest **release** version of ScalaLogging to your sbt (0.12.x) build definition:

    libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe" %% "scalalogging-slf4j" % "1.0.1"

The following example shows how to add a dependency to the latest **snapshot** version of ScalaLogging to your sbt (0.12.x) build definition:

    resolvers += Opts.resolver.sonatypeSnapshots

    libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe" %% "scalalogging-log4j" % "1.1.0-SNAPSHOT"

Example
-------

Small example of usage is located in sub-project `scalalogging-log4j-test`. See `Log4jLogExample.scala`.
To run example from sbt type `project scalalogging-log4j-test` and then type `run` command.
